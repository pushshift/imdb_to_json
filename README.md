This code will fetch data using a title code and convert the data to JSON format.

Example of usage:

./convert_imdb_to_json.py tt0117731

The movie_data.ndjson.zst file contains movie / episode data for over 1 million shows. The data is in ndjson format and is sorted by the number of votes. This data also contains basic metadata for each show including genres, start/end year, title, adult classification and run time.

Movie title codes and other metadata can be downloaded from here: https://datasets.imdbws.com/

This should get you started.
